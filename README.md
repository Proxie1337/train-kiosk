# train-kiosk
  ----------Java Skills Demo 1 - CSCA----------
  
A basic command-line simulation for a train ticket dispensary.

This is just a draft program, which is missing a couple of features,
such as keeping track of money earned and the amount of available seats.
However, it should show you the general gist of how to program a
basic train kiosk system. There are multiple approaches you could
take, however, this is just the way I chose to do it for this particular
draft piece.

Feel free to have a look at the code and try it out yourself.
