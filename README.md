# train-kiosk
  ----------Java Skills Demo 1 - CSCA----------
  
A basic command-line simulation for a train ticket dispensary.

This is just a draft program, which is missing a couple of things.
However, it should show you the general gist of how to program a
basic train kiosk system.

Feel free to have a look at the code and try it out yourself, or use
it to go back and reference over.

If you do use it, please try to avoid using the same names for the
variables and objects so Brendan doesn't think we're plagiarising.
