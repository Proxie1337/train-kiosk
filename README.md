# train-kiosk
  ---------------Java Skills Demo 1 - CSCA---------------
A basic command-line simulation for a train ticket dispensary.

This is just a draft program, which is missing a couple of things.
However, it should show you the general gist of how to program a
basic train kiosk system.

Feel free to have a look at the code and try it out yourself, or use
it to go back and reference over.
